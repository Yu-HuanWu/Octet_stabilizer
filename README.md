# Octet_stabilizer

## Background
A simple game that demonstrate how octet rule works in Chemistry. Bond to the atom that has the correct amount of valence electrons, be sure to avoid atoms that don't have the right number of electrons!

## Functionality & MVPs
In Octet Stabilizer, users will be able to:
- Move an atom around.
- Bond with another atom that match according to the octet rule.
- Start over if user's atom bump into an incorrect atom.
- See which molecules were created from the bonding.

In addition, this project will include:
- Instruction on how to play the game.
- Graphical explanation on the octet rule.
- Handy Dandy README.md

## Technologies
- Canvas
- Webpack
- npm

## Implementation Timeline
Day 1: Research physics of particles on canvas, setup project.
Day 2: Getting webpack up and running, set up canvas. Create UserAtom and Atom classes.
Day 3-4: Implement logics of collision detection, bonuncing physics, and ensure correct render on the canvas.
Day 5: Implement BindKeyHandler for user controls and assign graphics to instances.
Day 6: Deploy GitHub pages, double check to ensure correct references and links on GitHub pages.
